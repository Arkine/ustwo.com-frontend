/*
 *  RIMAGE
 *  Loads appropriate image size from wordpress
 *
 *  Notes: This component by default is an <img> with no style. However, in some cases
 *  we want to contain the image, scaling within a fixed height and maintaining aspect
 *  ratio, i.e. background-size: cover. In the markup the image is added as background-image
 *  (and the class added) and so uses the below styles.
