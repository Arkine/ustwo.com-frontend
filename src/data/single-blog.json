Also a bunch of Open Software and Open Hardware platforms (Arduino, Ninja Blocks, Raspberry Pi, Teagueduino, BeagleBone&#8230;) have opened up the world of hardware development, so people like us (developers and designers) can get stuck in and bring a completely different mindset to the development process &#8211; a mindset centred around users.</p>\n<p>\n<p>We still have loads to learn, but we’re getting there.

In a clever, yet surprising decision for a big company, Philips decided not to lock down the hub or sue 3rd party developers.
